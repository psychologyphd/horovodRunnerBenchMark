Authors: Jing Pan, Ph.D and Wendao Liu, doctoral student. 

This is the code for AAAI 2020 workshop 8 DLGMA paper titled "Benchmark Tests of Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Convolu-tional Network on HorovodRunner Enabled Spark Clusters". 

It has the MNIST task, Caltech 101 tasks, and GCN task. We show lift in scaling efficiency other than the GCN task. For Caltech 101 task, we have an additional file to implement rectified adam optimizer with HorovodRunner. We didn't report results of rectified adam in the main paper.
